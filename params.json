{"name":"Mouse Info","body":"![screenshot](http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/9772/20120424180316.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is a simple program that displays mouse related information. It shows the current position of the cursor (x and y), the color (in dec and hex) of that position, and the cursor id of the mouse. Copying any piece of data is effortless and can be done by either a button or hotkey. The program has two modes; manual and automatic. When in manual, information updates when you press F4. In automatic, information updates on the fly. \r\n\r\nFor instructions on compiling .au3 files see [here](https://github.com/matarz/tiny_timer/wiki/AutoIt-Files).","tagline":"Displays Mouse Related Information","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
